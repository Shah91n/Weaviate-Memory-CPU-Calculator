**üéØ Memory & CPU planning tool for Weaviate vector database deployments**

Beginner-friendly Estimator based on [official Weaviate documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/resources) to help you plan memory and CPU requirements for your vector database deployment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üßÆ **Accurate Calculations**
- **Memory**: 2x GC overhead rule + HNSW connections (1.5x avg)
- **CPU**: Official formula `1000ms √∑ latency √ó 80% efficiency`
- **Storage**: Vector + metadata + 20% overhead
- **All compression types**: PQ, BQ, SQ, RQ 8-bit, RQ 1-bit

### üéØ **Smart Planning**
- **Performance-based**: Uses target QPS + expected latency
- **Compression comparison**: Side-by-side memory savings
- **Deployment recommendations**: Docker ‚Üí Kubernetes based on scale
- **Optimization tips**: Automatic suggestions for your config

### üóúÔ∏è **Compression Support**
| Method | Memory Saved | Training | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **PQ** | 85% | ‚úÖ | Best balance |
| **BQ** | 97% | ‚ùå | Maximum savings |
| **SQ** | 75% | ‚úÖ | Fast compression |
| **RQ 8-bit** | 75% | ‚ùå | No training, 8-bit |
| **RQ 1-bit** | 97% | ‚ùå | No training, max savings |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Web App (Recommended)
**[Visit the live calculator](https://weaviate-memory-cpu-calculator.streamlit.app/)** - No installation needed!

### Option 2: Local Installation (For custom modifications or advanced use)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/Weaviate-Memory-CPU-Calculator.git
cd Weaviate-Memory-CPU-Calculator
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# Open: http://localhost:8501
```

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t weaviate-calculator .
docker run -p 8501:8501 weaviate-calculator
```

## üìä How It Works

### Memory Calculation
```python
# Vector memory (with 2x GC overhead)
vector_memory = objects √ó dimensions √ó 4 bytes √ó 2

# HNSW connections (1.5x average)
connections = objects √ó maxConnections √ó 1.5 √ó 10 bytes

# Total memory
total = vector_memory + connections
```

### CPU Calculation
```python
# Official Weaviate formula
qps_per_core = 1000ms √∑ expected_latency_ms √ó 0.8
min_cores = target_qps √∑ qps_per_core
recommended = min_cores √ó 2  # Headroom for imports
```
