## üìã Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd weaviate-calculator
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. **Open in browser:** http://localhost:8501

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t weaviate-calculator .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 weaviate-calculator
```

## üßÆ How It Works

### Memory Calculation (Official Formula)

```python
# Rule of thumb (recommended)
memory = 2 √ó (objects √ó dimensions √ó 4 bytes) + hnsw_connections

# Detailed calculation
vector_memory = objects √ó dimensions √ó 4 bytes
connections_memory = objects √ó (maxConnections √ó 1.5) √ó 10 bytes
total_memory = (vector_memory √ó 2) + connections_memory
```

**Why 2x multiplier?** Accounts for Go's garbage collection overhead and temporary allocations during imports.

### CPU Requirements (Official Weaviate Formula)

```python
# From official Weaviate benchmark documentation:
# "If Weaviate were single-threaded, throughput would equal 1s √∑ mean latency"
theoretical_qps_per_core = 1000ms √∑ latency_ms

# Apply real-world efficiency (80% due to synchronization)
realistic_qps_per_core = theoretical_qps_per_core √ó 0.8

# Calculate cores needed
min_cores = target_qps √∑ realistic_qps_per_core
recommended_cores = min_cores √ó 2  # headroom for imports and peaks
```

### Compression Impact

| Method | Memory Reduction | Training Required | Best For |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **PQ** | 85% reduction | ‚úÖ Yes | Production (best balance) |
| **BQ** | 97% reduction | ‚ùå No | Maximum savings |
| **SQ** | 75% reduction | ‚úÖ Yes | Fast compression |
| **RQ** | 75% reduction | ‚ùå No | No-config compression |

## üìä Example Configurations

| Use Case | Objects | Dimensions | Memory (No Compression) | Memory (PQ) | CPU Cores | Deployment |
|----------|---------|------------|-------------------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Personal Blog** | 10K | 384 | 0.1 GB | 0.02 GB | 2 | Docker |
| **E-commerce** | 100K | 768 | 0.6 GB | 0.1 GB | 4 | Docker Compose |
| **Knowledge Base** | 1M | 1536 | 12.3 GB | 1.8 GB | 8 | Kubernetes |
| **Enterprise RAG** | 10M | 1536 | 123 GB | 18.5 GB | 16 | K8s Cluster |
| **Large-scale SaaS** | 100M | 3072 | 2457 GB | 368 GB | 32+ | Multi-region K8s |

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Limit Weaviate to 80% of available memory
LIMIT_RESOURCES=true

# Set Go memory limit (10-20% of total memory)
GOMEMLIMIT=2GB

# Set CPU threads
GOMAXPROCS=16
```

### HNSW Configuration
```json
{
  "vectorIndexConfig": {
    "maxConnections": 32,        // Optimal for 768D+ vectors
    "efConstruction": 128,       // Build quality
    "ef": 100,                   // Query quality
    "dynamicEfMin": 100,
    "dynamicEfMax": 500
  }
}
```

### Compression Setup
```json
{
  "vectorIndexConfig": {
    "pq": {
